    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
        random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
        years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
        the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
        Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
        the word in classical literature, discovered the
        undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
        theory of ethics, very popular during the
        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
        ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
        section 1.10.32.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
